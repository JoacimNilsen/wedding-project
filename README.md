#Final project

This is my final project for the Technigo bootcamp.
The goal was to implement all the technologies we have learned during this 6 month course. The time we were expected to spend on the project is 80 hours.
My friends are getting married so I decided to make a website for their wedding, with various guestlist functions.
My stretch goal was to make a gallery in wich guests could upload images from the wedding and the party. I did not have time with this but I am currently working on it even to school is finished.
